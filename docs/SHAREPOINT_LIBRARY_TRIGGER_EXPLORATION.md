is it possible via an azure function to run a series of python scripts on the contents of an entire sharepoint library? 

Of course. Yes, it is absolutely possible to use an Azure Function to run a series of Python scripts on the contents of an entire SharePoint library. 

This is a powerful and common pattern for automating business processes, data extraction, and content manipulation within the Microsoft 365 ecosystem. 

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how it works, the key components involved, and the best practices to follow. 

 

 

High-Level Architecture 

The typical workflow looks like this: 

Trigger: Something starts the Azure Function. This could be a timer (e.g., "run every night at 1 AM"), an HTTP request (manual trigger or called by another service), or an event (e.g., a message placed in a queue). 

Authentication: The Azure Function securely authenticates with Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) to get permission to access the SharePoint library. This is the most critical step for security. 

Enumeration: The function's Python code uses the Microsoft Graph API or a SharePoint-specific API to list all the files and folders within the specified library. 

Iteration & Processing: The function loops through the list of files. For each file, it: 

Downloads the file content into the function's temporary memory or storage. 

Executes your series of Python scripts on that file content. 

(Optional) Uploads a modified file, updates metadata, saves results to a database, or sends a notification. 

Logging & Monitoring: The function logs its progress and any errors to Azure Application Insights for monitoring and debugging. 

 

 

Step-by-Step Implementation Guide 

1. Authentication: The App Registration 

You don't want to use your personal username and password in a script. Instead, you'll create an "App Registration" in Microsoft Entra ID. This acts as a service account for your function. 

Go to the Azure Portal > Microsoft Entra ID > App registrations > New registration. 

Give it a name (e.g., SharePointProcessorFunctionApp). 

API Permissions: This is where you grant the app rights to read/write to SharePoint. 

Go to "API permissions" > "Add a permission" > "Microsoft Graph". 

Choose "Application permissions" (since the function runs without a signed-in user). 

Add the necessary permissions. A good starting point is Sites.ReadWrite.All or Sites.Selected for a more granular, secure approach. 

Grant Admin Consent: An administrator must grant consent for these permissions. 

Create a Client Secret: Go to "Certificates & secrets" > "New client secret". Copy this secret value immediately and save it securely (e.g., in Azure Key Vault). You will not be able to see it again. 

Note Down IDs: From the "Overview" page, copy the Application (client) ID and the Directory (tenant) ID. 

2. The Azure Function 

Create the Function App: In the Azure Portal, create a new Function App. 

Runtime stack: Python 

Hosting: Consumption plan (pay-per-use, good for starting) or App Service Plan (for long-running tasks). 

Configuration: In the Function App's "Configuration" section, add your credentials as Application Settings. This is much more secure than hard-coding them. 

TENANT_ID: Your Directory (tenant) ID. 

CLIENT_ID: Your Application (client) ID. 

CLIENT_SECRET: Your client secret (or better, a reference to a secret in Azure Key Vault). 

SHAREPOINT_SITE_NAME: The name of your SharePoint site (e.g., contoso.sharepoint.com). 

SHAREPOINT_LIBRARY_NAME: The name of your document library (e.g., Shared Documents). 

3. The Python Code 

You'll need to install some libraries. Your requirements.txt file for the function will look like this:

azure-functions 
requests 
msal 
 

Here is a sample structure for a timer-triggered function (function_app.py). 

Python 

import logging 
import os 
import requests 
import msal 
import azure.functions as func 
 
# --- Configuration from Application Settings --- 
TENANT_ID = os.environ.get('TENANT_ID') 
CLIENT_ID = os.environ.get('CLIENT_ID') 
CLIENT_SECRET = os.environ.get('CLIENT_SECRET') 
SHAREPOINT_SITE_NAME = os.environ.get('SHAREPOINT_SITE_NAME') # e.g., 'yourtenant.sharepoint.com' 
SHAREPOINT_LIBRARY_NAME = os.environ.get('SHAREPOINT_LIBRARY_NAME') # e.g., 'Shared Documents' 
 
# --- Microsoft Graph API Endpoints --- 
AUTHORITY = f"https://login.microsoftonline.com/{TENANT_ID}" 
GRAPH_ENDPOINT = "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0" 
SCOPE = ["https://graph.microsoft.com/.default"] 
 
# Initialize MSAL app 
app = msal.ConfidentialClientApplication( 
    client_id=CLIENT_ID, 
    authority=AUTHORITY, 
    client_credential=CLIENT_SECRET 
) 
 
# --- Main Azure Function --- 
# This example uses a timer trigger, running every 4 hours. 
# For manual execution, you could use an HTTP trigger. 
app_func = func.FunctionApp() 
 
@app_func.schedule(schedule="0 */4 * * *", arg_name="myTimer", run_on_startup=False, 
              use_monitor=False)  
def process_sharepoint_library(myTimer: func.TimerRequest) -> None: 
    logging.info('Python timer trigger function executed.') 
     
    # 1. Get Access Token 
    token_result = app.acquire_token_for_client(scopes=SCOPE) 
    if "access_token" not in token_result: 
        logging.error("Failed to acquire access token.") 
        logging.error(f"Error: {token_result.get('error')}") 
        logging.error(f"Description: {token_result.get('error_description')}") 
        return 
 
    access_token = token_result['access_token'] 
    headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {access_token}'} 
 
    try: 
        # 2. Get Site and Drive (Library) ID 
        site_resp = requests.get(f"{GRAPH_ENDPOINT}/sites/{SHAREPOINT_SITE_NAME}:/sites/root", headers=headers).json() 
        site_id = site_resp['id'] 
 
        drive_resp = requests.get(f"{GRAPH_ENDPOINT}/sites/{site_id}/drives", headers=headers).json() 
        library_drive_id = next((d['id'] for d in drive_resp['value'] if d['name'] == SHAREPOINT_LIBRARY_NAME), None) 
 
        if not library_drive_id: 
            logging.error(f"Library '{SHAREPOINT_LIBRARY_NAME}' not found.") 
            return 
 
        # 3. List all files recursively in the library root 
        list_files_url = f"{GRAPH_ENDPOINT}/drives/{library_drive_id}/root/children" 
         
        while list_files_url: 
            files_resp = requests.get(list_files_url, headers=headers).json() 
             
            for item in files_resp.get('value', []): 
                # We only want to process files, not folders 
                if 'file' in item: 
                    file_name = item['name'] 
                    file_id = item['id'] 
                    logging.info(f"Processing file: {file_name}") 
 
                    # 4. Download file content 
                    download_url = item.get('@microsoft.graph.downloadUrl') 
                    if download_url: 
                        file_content_response = requests.get(download_url) 
                        if file_content_response.status_code == 200: 
                            file_content = file_content_response.content 
                             
                            # 5. RUN YOUR SCRIPTS ON THE CONTENT 
                            # This is where your custom logic goes. 
                            # For example: 
                            # result1 = script1.process(file_content) 
                            # result2 = script2.analyze(result1) 
                            # final_output = result2

                            # Optional: Upload the result back to another library or update metadata 
                            # update_metadata(headers, library_drive_id, file_id, {'status': 'processed'}) 
 
            # Check for pagination to handle libraries with >200 items 
            list_files_url = files_resp.get('@odata.nextLink') 
 
    except Exception as e: 
        logging.error(f"An error occurred: {e}") 
 
 

 

 

Important Considerations & Best Practices 

Timeouts: The default timeout for a Consumption plan function is 5 minutes (max 10). If processing your entire library takes longer, the function will time out. 

Solution A: Durable Functions. This is the best approach. You can have an "orchestrator" function that lists all the files and then calls an "activity" function for each file. This pattern is highly scalable and resilient. 

Solution B: Queue-based Processing. The initial function lists all files and puts a message for each file onto an Azure Storage Queue. A second, queue-triggered function then processes one file per execution. This is also very robust. 

Large Files & Memory: An Azure Function has memory limits (e.g., 1.5 GB on Consumption plan). Downloading and processing a very large file could exceed this. 

Solution: Use streaming if your processing scripts support it. Instead of response.content, iterate over response.iter_content() to process the file in chunks. 

Error Handling & Retries: What if one file is corrupt or a network call fails? Your code should be resilient. Wrap API calls in try...except blocks. For queue-based approaches, Azure Functions have built-in retry policies you can configure. 

Throttling: If you make too many API calls to SharePoint in a short period, it will throttle you (return 429 Too Many Requests or 503 Service Unavailable errors). 

Solution: Implement exponential backoff. When you get a 429 error, wait for the duration specified in the Retry-After header before trying again. 

In summary, while a single Timer-triggered function is a great starting point, for a large or mission-critical library, the recommended robust pattern is to use an orchestrator (HTTP/Timer triggered) that populates an Azure Queue, and a separate Queue-triggered function to do the actual file processing.
